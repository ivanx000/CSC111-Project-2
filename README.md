üèÄ NBA Shot Analyzer

NBA Shot Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis tool that builds and visualizes decision trees from NBA shot log data. It allows users to analyze a player‚Äôs shooting tendencies, calculate shot percentages, and visualize their best and worst shot scenarios using decision trees and interactive charts.

üìò Project Overview

This project reads NBA shot log data (2014‚Äì2015 season) from a CSV file and builds a decision tree model representing shot outcomes based on three main factors:

Shot Type ‚Üí Layup, Mid-Range, or 3-pointer

Touch Time ‚Üí Whether the player took the shot within 6 seconds or longer

Dribbles ‚Üí Whether the player took 5 or fewer dribbles before shooting

The program then calculates:

Each shot‚Äôs make/miss percentage

The best and worst shot scenarios for the player

A pie chart visualization of shot distributions

A decision tree graph using Graphviz

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nba-shot-analyzer.git
cd nba-shot-analyzer

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt file yet, create one with the following contents:

graphviz
matplotlib
mpld3
python-ta


‚ö†Ô∏è macOS users: You may need to install Graphviz separately:

brew install graphviz


Windows users: Download Graphviz from graphviz.org/download
 and add it to your PATH.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Make sure the file shot_logs[1].csv is in the same directory as your script.

Run the main program:

python tree_analyzer.py

When prompted, enter a player‚Äôs full name (e.g., LeBron James, Stephen Curry).

The program will:

Generate a decision tree visualization (.png file)

Create a pie chart of shot distributions (opens in your browser)

Print the best and worst shots in the terminal

üß† Example Output
Choose an NBA Player that played in the 2014-15 season (full name): stephen curry

Stephen Curry should TAKE MORE...
    - 3-pointers with 0-5 dribbles & a touch time of 0-5 seconds (58.3%)

and AVOID...
    - Mid-Range shots with 6+ dribbles & a touch time of 6+ seconds (21.7%)

Example Visuals

Decision Tree: Displays shooting outcomes as a hierarchical tree.

Pie Chart: Interactive browser-based chart (via mpld3).

üß© Key Functions
